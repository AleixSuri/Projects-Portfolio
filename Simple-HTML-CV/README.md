### Information architecture:
The website is structured as a single-page layout, designed to provide a simple and intuitive navigation experience for recruiters and hiring managers. 
At the top left, the ***Contact Information*** section displays essential details such as my phone number, email, and location, making it easy for users to quickly find ways to reach me. 
Positioned centrally on the page, the ***Profile*** section introduces me with a profile image and a brief summary of my background, education, and professional aspirations. 
This section serves as the user’s entry point to understand my overall profile and career goals.

Following the profile, the ***Education*** section is organized chronologically to outline my academic history, allowing recruiters to evaluate my educational qualifications at a glance.

### Visual design: 
The visual design of the website is modern and clean, using a dark-themed color palette and the Roboto font to create a professional and focused aesthetic. Key design decisions include:

- Color Palette: The background incorporates gradients for visual appeal and a professional feel. The header has a solid color of #212121, while the body transitions from #212121 to #06BCC1.
  The footer shifts from #06BCC1 to #BBA0B2, creating a cohesive design flow. This palette was carefully chosen using **coolors.co** for a harmonious look.
  White text (#FFFFFF) is used throughout for contrast, except in the Social Media section where the text is #212121 to add emphasis.

- Typography: The Roboto font is applied site-wide for readability and modern style. The font size is set to 60px for my name at the top, giving it prominence.
  Section titles, like "Profile" and "Education," use 30px for hierarchy, and other text elements are set to 20px for consistency and readability.

- Icons and Imagery: Minimalist icons guide the user in sections like “Profile”, “Education”, and “Projects Done”. Each section title includes a custom image as a bullet point, adding a unique touch.
  Interactive elements like project icons, social media links, decorative icons, and contact information feature hover animations to enhance user engagement.

- Layout and Spacing: Sections are separated by horizontal lines, creating a structured look. The centered profile image, name, and icons at the top establish balance.
  The “Projects Done” section uses a grid layout for easy navigation and quick access to project links.
  This layout, combined with visual and interactive elements, results in a streamlined, professional user experience.
